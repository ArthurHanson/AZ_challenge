Challenge 1: 
Write a program that finds the consecutive number ranges within in a sequence of integers. Consecutive numbers are integer numbers one after the other.

The program must accept as its first argument a path to an input filename. Each line in this input file contains sequence of integers separated by whitespace. 

Input Sample:
1 2 3 4 7 8 9 11 13
1 2 3 5 6 7 9 10 11 12
1 3 5 6 7 9 11 12 13

Output Sample:
1-4 7-9
1-3 5-7 9-12
5-7 11-13
